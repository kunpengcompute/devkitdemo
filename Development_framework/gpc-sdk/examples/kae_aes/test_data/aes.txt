The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]), 
is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) in 2001.

AES is a variant of the Rijndael block cipher[3] developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, 
who submitted a proposal[5] to NIST during the AES selection process.[6] Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different 
key and block sizes. For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but 
three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
